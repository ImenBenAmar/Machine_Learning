At noon on Wednesday crude oil futures touched $45 a barrel on news that inventories soared last week by the most in 34 years. \\nThe market wasn\\u2019t expecting that. It was bad enough that the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a supply increase nine times greater than analysts and observers were expecting last week. Those market seers were betting on an increase of a million barrels. Instead the API reported the increase was 9.3 million \\u2014 a miss of gigantic proportions. \\nOn Wednesday, however, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that the API\\u2019s estimate was far too low: Inventories last week jumped by 14.4 million barrels, forcing one of those observers, Bob Yawger, director of the futures division of Mizuho Securities USA, to exclaim: \\u201cYou could easily make the argument that [the EIA report is] the most bearish ... of all time.\\u201d He added, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing to support the market.\\u201d \\nThe futures market is driven by expectations. Ever since OPEC promised in September that it would have a working plan in place by November to cut production in order to \\u201cbalance\\u201d the market, crude oil futures have slowly inched up. The market managed to resist the temptation to sell off on news that the rig count in the United States was increasing, that the majors were increasing their capital expenditures for 2017, and that DUCs (wells developed but not completed) were coming into production. \\nWhat it couldn\\u2019t do was shrug off the news that Goldman Sachs, in a private memo to its customers (and revealed to Irina Slav at OilPrice.com), suggests that oil is headed for $40 a barrel: \\\"The lack of progress on implementing production quotas and the growing discord between OPEC producers suggests a declining probability of reaching a deal on November 30.\\\" \\nThis is the same company that \\u201csuggested\\u201d that oil could drop into the 20s late last year, which it did, touching $26 a barrel in February before rebounding. \\nOn top of that was the distressing news \\u2014 at least to those banking on higher prices and betting on that outcome \\u2014 that U.S. refiners are operating at only 85 percent of capacity, especially at a time when increased demands over the holidays would usually drive prices higher. \\nAdd to that the news that OPEC members, while meeting privately to hammer together some sort of deal to cut \\u2014 or at least freeze \\u2014 production, are increasing production at the same time. Iran is exempted from any participation in the proposed cuts, and is raising its production back to pre-sanction levels as quickly as it can; Iraq is demanding the same exemption as Iran, claiming that it needs increased revenues to fight ISIS; Russia is going its own way as it isn\\u2019t a member of the cartel; and Libya and Nigeria are merrily ignoring the charade, adding another 800,000 barrels to global supply last month. \\nThe so-called \\u201cbalance\\u201d of the oil markets between supply and demand is many months off, while the futures market is likely to continue its breathtaking selloff to $40 and perhaps even lower. \\n\\nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.

Diplomatic cables sent last week from Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson to all American embassies instructed consular officials to broadly increase scrutiny. It was the first evidence of the \\u201cextreme vetting\\u201d Mr. Trump promised during the presidential campaign. The new rules generally do not apply to citizens of 38 countries  \\u2014   including most of Europe and longstanding allies like Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea  \\u2014   who can be speedily admitted into the United States under the visa waiver program. That program does not cover citizens from any country in the Middle East or Africa. Even stricter security checks for people from six predominantly Muslim nations remain on hold because federal courts have temporarily blocked President Trump\\u2019s travel ban. But Mr. Trump and his national security team are not waiting to toughen the rules to decide who can enter the United States. Embassy officials must now scrutinize a broader pool of visa applicants to determine if they pose security risks to the United States, according to four cables sent between March 10 and March 17. That extra scrutiny will include asking applicants detailed questions about their background and making mandatory checks of social media history if a person has ever been in territory controlled by the Islamic State. Mr. Trump has spoken regularly of his concern about the threat of \\u201cradical Islamic terrorism\\u201d from immigrants. But it is unclear who, exactly, will be targeted for the extra scrutiny since Mr. Tillerson\\u2019s cables leave that decision up to security officers at each embassy. Still, taken together, consular officials and immigration advocates said the administration\\u2019s moves will increase the likelihood of denial for those seeking to come to America, and will further slow down a bureaucratic approval process that can already take months or even years for those flagged for extra investigation. In 2016, the United States issued more than 10 million visas. There are legitimate reasons someone might be targeted, such as evidence of a connection to terrorism or crime. But advocates also said they worry about people being profiled for extra scrutiny because of their name or nationality. \\u201cThis will certainly slow down the screening process and impose a substantial burden on these applicants,\\u201d said Greg Chen, the director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \\u201cIt will make it much harder and create substantial delays. \\u201d The cables from Mr. Tillerson, which were reported by Reuters, make clear that the Trump administration wants a more intense focus on the potential for a serious threat when making decisions about who should receive a visa. \\u201cConsular officers should not hesitate to refuse any case presenting security concerns,\\u201d Mr. Tillerson wrote in the cables, titled \\u201cImplementing Immediate Heightened Screening and Vetting of Visa Applications. \\u201d \\u201cAll visa decisions are national security decisions,\\u201d the secretary of state added. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Obama administration of failing to properly screen people coming into the United States, a claim former officials in that administration reject. As a candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to ban all incoming Muslims until leaders could \\u201cfigure out what the hell is going on. \\u201d Later, he backed away from a total ban on Muslims but promised \\u201cextreme vetting\\u201d of those trying to come to the United States. The president\\u2019s first attempt to put tougher screening in place was the executive order aimed at temporarily blocking refugees and people whom Mr. Trump called \\u201cbad dudes\\u201d from predominantly Muslim countries. Courts blocked the first version of the president\\u2019s order after a chaotic rollout just days into his term. A second order was blocked this month. But on March 6, the same day that Mr. Trump issued his revised travel ban, he also wrote a presidential memorandum ordering the secretary of state, the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security to \\u201cimplement protocols and procedures\\u201d to enhance visa screening. Administration officials said the cables from Mr. Tillerson are among the actions being taken to carry out that memorandum. Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said the steps aim \\u201cto more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the United States. \\u201d Most people seeking entry to the United States, for family, business or tourism reasons, must apply for a visa. Embassy officials can deny a visa for anyone suspected of being a threat, conducting fraud or planning to stay longer than allowed. The   unclassified cable that Mr. Tillerson sent on March 15, which was provided to The New York Times, makes clear that the process of securing an entry visa is about to get harder and longer at diplomatic posts around the globe. \\u201cConsular chiefs must immediately convene post\\u2019s law enforcement and intelligence community partners\\u201d to develop what Mr. Tillerson described in the cable as \\u201csets of   populations warranting increased scrutiny. \\u201d People targeted for increased scrutiny, Mr. Tillerson said in his cable, may be subject to a decision made only after more rigorous screening. The March 15 cable suggests areas of inquiry during a required interview, including: the applicant\\u2019s travel history, addresses and work history for 15 years and all phone numbers, email addresses and social media handles used by the applicant in the past five years. Another cable, sent two days later, indicated that consular officers should not begin asking for the   travel and work histories until the State Department received authorization for those questions from the Office of Management and Budget. It is unclear why that permission had not been granted. The State Department also urged its embassy officials to delay or reschedule interviews if an applicant was unable to provide all of the information demanded. And Mr. Tillerson acknowledged in the cables that the extra scrutiny would cause \\u201cbacklogs to rise,\\u201d even as he recommended that officials should each interview no more than 120 visa applicants each day. Mr. Chen, of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, questioned how a single interviewer who conducts 120 interviews per day  \\u2014   at about five minutes per interview  \\u2014   could improve security for the visa process. \\u201cIt\\u2019s highly unlikely they could obtain information that demonstrates whether someone is a national security threat in such a brief interview process,\\u201d he said. In addition to the new security protocols for embassies, the four diplomatic cables sent last week offer a view into how the administration hopes to enact the travel ban if the president ever gets the chance. The March 15 cable, which was sent before federal courts blocked the revised travel ban, increases scrutiny on people from the six countries in the president\\u2019s executive order: Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Somalia and Libya. It also includes a section calling for increased scrutiny for Iraqi nationals. For those from the six countries covered in the ban, the cable envisions a process for potentially granting a limited number of exemptions from the ban by issuing a waiver, but only after vigorous screening. Those people would be questioned about their past 15 years of travel and occupational history, as well as whether they have visited territory controlled by the Islamic State. A March 16 cable suspended \\u201call enforcement\\u201d regarding the tougher scrutiny on the countries from Mr. Trump\\u2019s executive order.\",\n          \"On Wednesday\\u2019s broadcast of CNN\\u2019s \\u201cNew Day,\\u201d Senator Al Franken ( ) stated that he would still appear with comedian Kathy Griffin, and denounced the picture depicting her holding up President Trump\\u2019s severed head as something that \\u201chad no business\\u201d being in the public discourse and a \\u201chorrible mistake. \\u201d  Franken said that Griffin deserved to be denounced for the picture, and that he thought she went too far.

At noon on Wednesday crude oil futures touched $45 a barrel on news that inventories soared last week by the most in 34 years. \\nThe market wasn\\u2019t expecting that. It was bad enough that the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a supply increase nine times greater than analysts and observers were expecting last week. Those market seers were betting on an increase of a million barrels. Instead the API reported the increase was 9.3 million \\u2014 a miss of gigantic proportions. \\nOn Wednesday, however, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that the API\\u2019s estimate was far too low: Inventories last week jumped by 14.4 million barrels, forcing one of those observers, Bob Yawger, director of the futures division of Mizuho Securities USA, to exclaim: \\u201cYou could easily make the argument that [the EIA report is] the most bearish ... of all time.\\u201d He added, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing to support the market.\\u201d \\nThe futures market is driven by expectations. Ever since OPEC promised in September that it would have a working plan in place by November to cut production in order to \\u201cbalance\\u201d the market, crude oil futures have slowly inched up. The market managed to resist the temptation to sell off on news that the rig count in the United States was increasing, that the majors were increasing their capital expenditures for 2017, and that DUCs (wells developed but not completed) were coming into production. \\nWhat it couldn\\u2019t do was shrug off the news that Goldman Sachs, in a private memo to its customers (and revealed to Irina Slav at OilPrice.com), suggests that oil is headed for $40 a barrel: \\\"The lack of progress on implementing production quotas and the growing discord between OPEC producers suggests a declining probability of reaching a deal on November 30.\\\" \\nThis is the same company that \\u201csuggested\\u201d that oil could drop into the 20s late last year, which it did, touching $26 a barrel in February before rebounding. \\nOn top of that was the distressing news \\u2014 at least to those banking on higher prices and betting on that outcome \\u2014 that U.S. refiners are operating at only 85 percent of capacity, especially at a time when increased demands over the holidays would usually drive prices higher. \\nAdd to that the news that OPEC members, while meeting privately to hammer together some sort of deal to cut \\u2014 or at least freeze \\u2014 production, are increasing production at the same time. Iran is exempted from any participation in the proposed cuts, and is raising its production back to pre-sanction levels as quickly as it can; Iraq is demanding the same exemption as Iran, claiming that it needs increased revenues to fight ISIS; Russia is going its own way as it isn\\u2019t a member of the cartel; and Libya and Nigeria are merrily ignoring the charade, adding another 800,000 barrels to global supply last month. \\nThe so-called \\u201cbalance\\u201d of the oil markets between supply and demand is many months off, while the futures market is likely to continue its breathtaking selloff to $40 and perhaps even lower. \\n\\nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.

Diplomatic cables sent last week from Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson to all American embassies instructed consular officials to broadly increase scrutiny. It was the first evidence of the \\u201cextreme vetting\\u201d Mr. Trump promised during the presidential campaign. The new rules generally do not apply to citizens of 38 countries  \\u2014   including most of Europe and longstanding allies like Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea  \\u2014   who can be speedily admitted into the United States under the visa waiver program. That program does not cover citizens from any country in the Middle East or Africa. Even stricter security checks for people from six predominantly Muslim nations remain on hold because federal courts have temporarily blocked President Trump\\u2019s travel ban. But Mr. Trump and his national security team are not waiting to toughen the rules to decide who can enter the United States. Embassy officials must now scrutinize a broader pool of visa applicants to determine if they pose security risks to the United States, according to four cables sent between March 10 and March 17. That extra scrutiny will include asking applicants detailed questions about their background and making mandatory checks of social media history if a person has ever been in territory controlled by the Islamic State. Mr. Trump has spoken regularly of his concern about the threat of \\u201cradical Islamic terrorism\\u201d from immigrants. But it is unclear who, exactly, will be targeted for the extra scrutiny since Mr. Tillerson\\u2019s cables leave that decision up to security officers at each embassy. Still, taken together, consular officials and immigration advocates said the administration\\u2019s moves will increase the likelihood of denial for those seeking to come to America, and will further slow down a bureaucratic approval process that can already take months or even years for those flagged for extra investigation. In 2016, the United States issued more than 10 million visas. There are legitimate reasons someone might be targeted, such as evidence of a connection to terrorism or crime. But advocates also said they worry about people being profiled for extra scrutiny because of their name or nationality. \\u201cThis will certainly slow down the screening process and impose a substantial burden on these applicants,\\u201d said Greg Chen, the director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \\u201cIt will make it much harder and create substantial delays. \\u201d The cables from Mr. Tillerson, which were reported by Reuters, make clear that the Trump administration wants a more intense focus on the potential for a serious threat when making decisions about who should receive a visa. \\u201cConsular officers should not hesitate to refuse any case presenting security concerns,\\u201d Mr. Tillerson wrote in the cables, titled \\u201cImplementing Immediate Heightened Screening and Vetting of Visa Applications. \\u201d \\u201cAll visa decisions are national security decisions,\\u201d the secretary of state added. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Obama administration of failing to properly screen people coming into the United States, a claim former officials in that administration reject. As a candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to ban all incoming Muslims until leaders could \\u201cfigure out what the hell is going on. \\u201d Later, he backed away from a total ban on Muslims but promised \\u201cextreme vetting\\u201d of those trying to come to the United States. The president\\u2019s first attempt to put tougher screening in place was the executive order aimed at temporarily blocking refugees and people whom Mr. Trump called \\u201cbad dudes\\u201d from predominantly Muslim countries. Courts blocked the first version of the president\\u2019s order after a chaotic rollout just days into his term. A second order was blocked this month. But on March 6, the same day that Mr. Trump issued his revised travel ban, he also wrote a presidential memorandum ordering the secretary of state, the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security to \\u201cimplement protocols and procedures\\u201d to enhance visa screening. Administration officials said the cables from Mr. Tillerson are among the actions being taken to carry out that memorandum. Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said the steps aim \\u201cto more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the United States. \\u201d Most people seeking entry to the United States, for family, business or tourism reasons, must apply for a visa. Embassy officials can deny a visa for anyone suspected of being a threat, conducting fraud or planning to stay longer than allowed. The   unclassified cable that Mr. Tillerson sent on March 15, which was provided to The New York Times, makes clear that the process of securing an entry visa is about to get harder and longer at diplomatic posts around the globe. \\u201cConsular chiefs must immediately convene post\\u2019s law enforcement and intelligence community partners\\u201d to develop what Mr. Tillerson described in the cable as \\u201csets of   populations warranting increased scrutiny. \\u201d People targeted for increased scrutiny, Mr. Tillerson said in his cable, may be subject to a decision made only after more rigorous screening. The March 15 cable suggests areas of inquiry during a required interview, including: the applicant\\u2019s travel history, addresses and work history for 15 years and all phone numbers, email addresses and social media handles used by the applicant in the past five years. Another cable, sent two days later, indicated that consular officers should not begin asking for the   travel and work histories until the State Department received authorization for those questions from the Office of Management and Budget. It is unclear why that permission had not been granted. The State Department also urged its embassy officials to delay or reschedule interviews if an applicant was unable to provide all of the information demanded. And Mr. Tillerson acknowledged in the cables that the extra scrutiny would cause \\u201cbacklogs to rise,\\u201d even as he recommended that officials should each interview no more than 120 visa applicants each day. Mr. Chen, of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, questioned how a single interviewer who conducts 120 interviews per day  \\u2014   at about five minutes per interview  \\u2014   could improve security for the visa process. \\u201cIt\\u2019s highly unlikely they could obtain information that demonstrates whether someone is a national security threat in such a brief interview process,\\u201d he said. In addition to the new security protocols for embassies, the four diplomatic cables sent last week offer a view into how the administration hopes to enact the travel ban if the president ever gets the chance. The March 15 cable, which was sent before federal courts blocked the revised travel ban, increases scrutiny on people from the six countries in the president\\u2019s executive order: Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Somalia and Libya. It also includes a section calling for increased scrutiny for Iraqi nationals. For those from the six countries covered in the ban, the cable envisions a process for potentially granting a limited number of exemptions from the ban by issuing a waiver, but only after vigorous screening. Those people would be questioned about their past 15 years of travel and occupational history, as well as whether they have visited territory controlled by the Islamic State. A March 16 cable suspended \\u201call enforcement\\u201d regarding the tougher scrutiny on the countries from Mr. Trump\\u2019s executive order.\",\n          \"On Wednesday\\u2019s broadcast of CNN\\u2019s \\u201cNew Day,\\u201d Senator Al Franken ( ) stated that he would still appear with comedian Kathy Griffin, and denounced the picture depicting her holding up President Trump\\u2019s severed head as something that \\u201chad no business\\u201d being in the public discourse and a \\u201chorrible mistake. \\u201d  Franken said that Griffin deserved to be denounced for the picture, and that he thought she went too far. He added, \\u201cKathy is a friend, and she\\u2019s a terrific comedian, but what  \\u2014   this had no business being in our public discourse. And I talked to her. She apologized, a real fulsome apology. She\\u2019s actually begged for forgiveness, and I believe in forgiveness. \\u201d Franken further stated, \\u201cI think she did the right thing. I think asking for forgiveness and acknowledging that this  \\u2014   this was a horrible mistake. \\u201d Interviewer Alisyn Camerota then asked Franken, \\u201cAnd you\\u2019re still going to appear with her?\\u201d He responded, \\u201cYes. \\u201d (  GOP War Room) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
